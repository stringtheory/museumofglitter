This is the static website for the Museum of Glitter. 

The Museum of Glitter is built using the latest in high performance web
technologies.

The foundation of our stack is the the NoNopeSQL database,
the server side web application framework, alferrikako.js,
the client side frontend-framework, Senpaga.oh.no.js and Node.js,
which is based on the JavaScript runtime environment.
We use logic, so much logic based templates using using Ekkent.hipster.io
We manage our styles using SCMSCSCSS. There was also some webpack, yarn, yo-yo,
yolo, and chipmunk that we are pretty sure handles package management.
Our primary package delivery method is FedEX.

This page is built with HTML & CSS. It doesnt even have multiple pages, we just
were lazy and used tabs. This web page is for a single day selfie palace parody!
Why, dear god why, would make performance sucking single page web app.

We want to use all of your performance putting 15 animated glitter gif's on the
page. Lets Rock this page like it is 1995.

There is no javascript, what would it do? Render a template???? WE CAN JUST
PUT THE TEXT IN THE F%$*ing PAGE! So we can make a fancy pants Single Page
Web App??? THIS IS A SINGLE PAGE "WEB APP", not to repeat ourselves, but we
were lazy and used tabs - so all the stuff is on this one page.
Tabs that are just powered by toggling checkboxes using CSS, thank you very much.
Put that in your pipe and smoke it.

In case you were curious:
Senpaga - free in Esperanto
ekkert - nothing in Icelandic
alferrikako - unnecessary in Basque
