# The Museum of Glitter

## Tech Stack

This is the static website for the [Museum of Glitter](https://themuseumofglitter.com/), 
built using the latest in high performance web technologies.

The foundation of our stack is the the NoNopeSQL database, the SPARQL Protocol
and RDF Query Language, and the server side web application framework 
serverless-server-served.js. 

The client side frontend-framework is 
redacted-reflect-refactor-oh-no.js, deploy-only-on-friday.js, 
No.js, & and Node.js, which is based on the JavaScript(ish) runtime 
environment. We use the logic, so much logic based template framework 90s-web.ninja.
Styles are managed using SCMSCSCSS3 and post-apocalyptically-processed with the MegaVibe9000. 

There was also some webpack, yarn, yo-yo, yolo, and chipmunk 
that we are pretty sure handles package management. Our primary package 
delivery method is FedEX. 

Our DevOps Pipelines are powered by HI (Human Intelligence) with a foundational 
CI/CD (Cat Intelligence/Cats DESTROY) architecture.

## The Real Secret Sauce

This page is built with HTML & CSS. It doesnt even have multiple pages, we just
were lazy and used tabs. This web page was for a single day selfie palace parody!
Why, dear god why, would make performance sucking single page web app.

We want to use all of your performance putting 15 animated glitter gif's on the
page. Lets Rock this page like it is 1995. 

There is no javascript, what would it do? Render a template???? WE CAN JUST PUT 
THE TEXT IN THE [insert curse word] PAGE! 
Make a fancy pants Single Page Web App??? THIS IS A SINGLE PAGE "WEB APP", not to 
repeat ourselves, but we were lazy and used tabs - so all the stuff is on this one 
page. Tabs that are just powered by toggling checkboxes using CSS, put that in your 
fanny pack and zip it.

**Why is this page still up?**

- It's a place you can visit where you will not get asked to accept a cookie policy,
- making it one of the calmest and least frustrating places on the internet.

- This site still gets a bunch of traffic. We think. We didnt put any tracking on it.

- Many excellent contributors wrote excellent examples of a well formatted issue
  tickets. There is still so much work to be done.
